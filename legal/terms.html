                                        Terms and Conditions, you should immediately stop using the Website.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Nohassls provides the platform connecting you anonymously with the financial institutions
                                        or financial services companies (collectively known as “Providers”), and allowing you to 
                                        enquire about a product or service before releasing your identity.  The NoHassls Website 
                                        facilitates the connectivity of asking and receiving preliminary quotes between you and the 
                                        Providers.  </p>


                                    <p>Biyers is not a financial institution or financial services Provider and we are not suggesting
                                        you search, select and apply for any particular product or services or any particular Provider 
                                        that are listed or linked to on the NoHassls Website. </p>


                                    <p>Importantly, you should carry out your own search. We recommend that you take all 
                                        necessary measures and precautions before you engage or rely on any information provided 
                                        by or obtained from by the participating Provider or seek to rely on any information 
                                        provided by the Provider. Before making any commitment of a legal or financial nature you 
                                        should seek advice from a qualified and registered legal practitioner or investment adviser.
                                        No material contained or linked to this Website should be construed or relied upon as 
                                        providing recommendations in relation to any legal or financial product.</p>


                                    <p>We cannot and do not guarantee that the participating Provider will be able to provide the 
                                        services requested. Consequently, you agree and acknowledge that we may not be able to 
                                        provide the service requested by you notwithstanding the submission of all required 
                                        information on your part.</p>


                                    <p>Once you have selected a particular Provider and you have provided them with your 
                                        personal information, you will be dealing with the Provider directly and not with us, and you
                                        will be subject to their separate Terms and Conditions and Privacy Statement conditions.
                                        The NoHassls Website connects you to the third party Providers such as a financial
                                        institution or financial services provider or other organisations that will provide you with the
                                        relevant information directly.</p>

                                    <p>We reserve the right to change Providers and other organisation listed on this Website and
                                        information about them, at any time, without any notice. You should be aware, that we may 
                                        not have listed every Provider and we continue to add additional Providers at any time.
                                        We accept no responsibility in respect of any such information or any change to that
